// Title -- Double the value of the array

// Make the double() function return a new array with each value twice as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array. 

// MY SOLUTION
function double(array) {
    // Use array.map() to return a new array with each value twice
    // as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array.
  
  return array.map(item => item * 2)
}
